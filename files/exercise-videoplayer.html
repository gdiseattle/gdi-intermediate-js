			<p>In this exercise, you'll practice using JSON to dynamically build up HTML. The starter webpage already has the videos described in JSON and functions that turn them into an interactive list.</p>
			<p>Go through these steps, and do as many as you can in the time we have:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Download <a href="json-starter.zip">json_starter.zip</a>. Unzip the files and ensure that index.html works in the browser.</li>
				<li>Read through the code in <code>script.js</code> to make sure you understand how it works.</li>
				<li>Add an additional video to the JSON, so that you have 4 videos listed.</li>
				<li>When you click on the video, it shows the video player on the page. Make it so that it also shows an <code>h2</code> with the video title above the <code>iframe</code>.</li>
				<li>Add an <code>author</code> property to each video in the JSON and display that next to the title.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Bonus</h2>
			<p>Bonus: Add a <code>favorite</code> property to each video which is either true or false, and use that to decide whether to put a red border around the video in the list.</p>
			<h2>Tip</h2>
			<p>Make sure that you use your browser developer tools to make debugging easier while working on this. Check for errors, and use <code>console.log()</code> to figure out how far your code makes it, and what the values of your variables are along the way.</p>
